Thank you, AWS, for erroring out half of
my dashboard, I'm glad your software's
so "stable".

Thank you, Google, for making Android
suck.
(On a less sarcastic note, you were onto
something with Chromebooks. Most people,
who just email things, don't need all the
power...consumption that Windows laptops
bring. Just wish it didn't have ChromeOS)

Thank you, Brendan Eich, for stuffing
JavaScript into our browsers. That little
language would not be so successful if
it actually had to hold its own. Better
than Lua tho

Thank you, Microsoft, for stuffing ads
and spyware onto our Windows computers,
and thank you in advance for replacing
the start menu with CoPilot, too! The
Linux community wouldn't be so diverse
if it weren't for your idiocy.
